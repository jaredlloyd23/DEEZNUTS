    <h1> ACCU Communicator </h1>
    <p>
      Nearly every high school student has a mobile phone 
      these days and most of them bring them to school. <br> Teacher's 
      say they're a distraction and ban the children from using 
      them. I say embrace the technology. <br> How about an app that has 
      a big red button on the screen that says "I don't understand" 
      the teacher also has a phone or computer display that shows 
      a <br> graph of how many students don't understand. Open Communication 
      with the teacher. So this way they don't feel embarrassed about 
      not knowing what to do.
    </p>
